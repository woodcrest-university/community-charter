# Rental Agreement and Conditions

When you choose to rent within Woodcrest, you're agreeing to adhere to the following conditions:
- All Woodcrest tenants and subtenants must follow the rules of the sim, as well as the Linden Labs TOS. Repeated violations of any rules could result in permanent banishment plus termination of your rental unit without a refund.
- Any rentals designated as a "Shop" are intended for storefront/shop use only! Do not use shop units as a residential home. 
- Shops are for RP purposes only. Do not actually sell merchandise or services for L$ without approval from a Woodcrest staff member.
- 
### **Region Rezzer Limits**
Linden Lab allows only **100 “rezzers” per region**. If you rez even a single prim, you count as one rezzer in the system. Because of this, we must enforce limits:

- **Max 2 tenants/subtenants per rental rez box** (sometimes 3 in special cases).
- Please be selective with subtenants. We can’t make exceptions for larger groups.
- **Dorms:** Limited to **1 tenant/subtenant per room**. Dorms will also be limited to **60 LI Max per room** with no exceptions or increases.
- If you have prims out on a region *that is not one in which you rent*, they will be returned unless we are informed ahead of time they are for an event. (This does not apply to temporary rezzing for short-term roleplay under 2 hours.)

### **Rental Moves**
We’re also tightening our policy on moving rentals:

- Moving between rentals is limited. If you’ve already moved **twice**, we will likely decline additional moves.
- Choosing a new rental after your previous one expires is still permitted.
- **Moving your rent to a different Casperlet mat while you have an active rental is no longer allowed.** Please finish your current rental before starting another.

### Land Group Membership
- Tenants and subtenants must be in the group titled "Woodcrest Landgroup". Otherwise, objects will be automatically returned. Invites will only be sent after a unit is paid. 
- If your rental meter won't invite you to the group, contact a Woodcrest staff member.

### Decorating and Prim Usage
- Tenants must be lag-conscious when decorating. We hold the right to return any rezzed objects that are found to cause excessive lag to our sims.
- Permanent prims must remain within the parcel or room boundaries. Any unauthorized or stray prims found beyond rented property will be returned.
- Pets and vehicles: You may temporarily rez one while you are RPing. However, please do not leave pets or vehicles permanently rezzed, including inside your unit.
- If your rental expires, your items will be returned.

### Fees and Rates
- All rentals on the London Docks Sim use the following rate for pricing: **L$2.5 per prim, plus a flat L$25 maintenance fee**.
- Prim limits may be upgraded in increments of 10. Maximum limits are based upon unit type and prim availability.

### Privacy and Security
- Woodcrest is a roleplay community. Privacy could be affected by players looking to interact. However, players may not enter your residency without permission (residential units only - *does not apply to shops, see below*). Report trespassers to a moderator immediately.
- Security orbs are not allowed.

### Roleplay Consent Signage (Shops Only)

All rentals designated as "Shops" are considered public-facing RP spaces. To ensure clarity of consent within the community and to uphold Section 3.0 of the Woodcrest Code of Conduct, **every business rental is required to display an official Roleplay Consent Sign.**

These signs are placed and managed by staff and are considered part of the parcel infrastructure. They are **immovable and must remain unobstructed and clearly visible** at all times.

#### Tenant Responsibilities

- Maintain a valid RP Consent Notecard inside the sign, specifying what kinds of RP are permitted (or not) on the property.
- Keep the sign **set to the appropriate state** (`APPROVED` or `NOT APPROVED`) based on current consent terms.
- **Do not** cover, resize, hide, or alter the sign in any way.

#### Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with this system - including tampering with signs, failing to maintain the required notecard, or intentionally misrepresenting RP consent - **may result in eviction without refund.**

This policy protects both business owners and the broader community by removing ambiguity and helping all players respect boundaries. It is considered a mandatory part of the Woodcrest Rental Covenant.

### Additional Terms
- Subtenants are limited to **TWO** additional subtenants, resulting in **THREE** tenants including the leaseor.
- There are no refunds. Only credit transfer from one unit to another.
- If you fail to pay your rent within your unit's "overdue" period, then continue renting the same unit, we may remove time from your meter equal to the overdue period. This is done in fairness to other renters, so nobody gets "free rental time".
