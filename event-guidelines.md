# Woodcrest Event Guidelines

## General Guidelines for Events

### Event Types

While not an exhaustive list, the following are the generally accepted event types that may be referenced throughout these guidelines:

- Classes
- Sim-Wide
- Group Restricted (e.g. house limited)
- Student Council (e.g. Electioneering, Spirit Week)
- Greek Council (e.g. Rush, Greek Games)
- Pop-Ups
- OOC

### Scheduling & Event Priority

Events are scheduled via the Woodcrest Discord which then syncs up to the Google Calendar and Woodcrest website. Recurring Events may require toggling on the Google Calendar.

#### Event Planning Procedure

To schedule an event, the following procedure must be followed:

1. **Create a thread** in the #event-planning forum on Discord containing the following required information:
   - Name of event
   - Date/Time of event
   - Details of the event
   - A poster to be used to advertise the event
   - Whether the region media stream is required (i.e. DJs, music streams, etc)

2. **Discussion period** - Anyone with the Event Coordinator role may discuss and help resolve any potential conflicts within the thread

3. **Moderator approval** - Wait for a Moderator or Administrator to approve the event before scheduling

4. **Calendar creation** - Once approved, add the event to the calendar and post the event link in the thread

Events may be scheduled by any member with the Event Coordinator role on Discord or a Moderator. Reach out to the most appropriate person to schedule your event (i.e. House Social Chair).

Classes should continue to be managed via the Faculty Lead.

Where conflicts exists between events the following priority must be considered:

1. Classes
2. Student Council & Greek Council
3. Sim-Wide
4. Group Restricted
5. OOC
6. Pop-Ups

In practice, this means that Classes should not be cancelled during Council 'weeks' (e.g. Rush, Spirit Week) unless the professor wishes to cancel or reschedule their classes. Equally Sim-Wide events should be checked by the relevant Council during their weeks prior to scheduling to avoid taking preferred slots.

During Group Restricted bookings another event type may be scheduled in the same slot but please do be considerate of the group restricted booking in terms of attendance, location and the radio stream.

Pop-Ups must not be directly announced prior to any scheduled event to avoid 'event fatigue' which may reduce the turn-out of the priorly planned event. Pop-Ups/After-Parties are allowed without schedule. Where Pop-Ups are continuously run, we reserve the right to ask that these are coordinated and scheduled in future.

**Pop-Up events require moderator approval before switching the region media stream away from the pre-approved stream.** This ensures coordination with other events and prevents stream conflicts.

All OOC events must be approved by Administration prior to scheduling.

### Locations

While events can and should pick any location that logically matches the theme, audience and scale of the event the following should be considered:

**For University-related events, the following locations should be considered in order of priority:**

1. Woodcrest University
2. London Docks / Woodcrest North
3. Woodcrest Bay
4. Event Platform

**For General, non-university based events, the following locations should be considered in order of priority:**

1. London Docks / Woodcrest North
2. Woodcrest Bay
3. Woodcrest University
4. Event Platform

**For OOC events** please contact Administration to schedule your location but this is likely to be:

- Woodcrest Bay - Blackwell Rock
- Event Platform

Any ground level existing location or event structures (see below) may be considered for hosting events.

Usage of a sim-owned or rented business must get approval of the appropriate manager prior to setup. Where no manager exists, Moderators may approve for sim-owned businesses, rentals remain at the sole discretion of their tenants.

The following locations are pre-approved for event usage. This list is in no particular priority order:

| Region | Location |
|--------|----------|
| **Woodcrest University** | The Quad |
| | Athletics Center |
| | Beaver Bistro |
| | Thornbrook Institute of Fashion and Arts |
| | Dance Academy |
| | Football Field |
| | Administration Building |
| | Greenhouse |
| | Library |
| | Starpugs Upper Stage |
| | Beach |
| **London Docks** | Town Hall Plaza |
| | Botanic Park |
| | Church |
| | Wooded Area |
| | Beach |
| | The Lantern Hall |
| | Greek Row & Pool |
| **Woodcrest Bay** | Beach |
| | Blackwell Rock |
| **Woodcrest North** | TBC |

### Land Impact Limits

| Region | Land Impact Limits |
|--------|--------------------|
| Woodcrest University | 500 LI<br>1000 LI (with Moderator approval) |
| London Docks | 500 LI<br>1000 LI (with Moderator approval) |
| Woodcrest Bay | 500 LI<br>1000 LI (with Moderator approval) |
| Woodcrest North | 500 LI<br>1000 LI (with Moderator approval) |

Event planners should make every effort to keep prims under the maximum limits and make use of low LI items in their builds and decor.

Land Impact Limits for floats, Rush, temporary tents, etc will be subject to Administration decisions at the time and communicated. For reference this is likely to be in the 25 LI to 75 LI range.

Administrators may waive or issue increased Land Impact Limits on a case-by-case basis in exceptional circumstances when requested.

### Setup & Teardown

- Events should not be set up more than a week prior to the event date, and should ideally be set up as close to the event date as possible.
- Events should be appropriately sized for and blended into the set up location and should be grounded in realism.
- All event builds and decor should be removed within 24 hours after the event has taken place.
- Where prior events are scheduled, an event should not be set up until prior events have been removed in order to conserve Land Impact.
- An event may have up to two (2) approved external "Rez Permits" roles granted per event. These must be revoked after the event has concluded. All Rez Permit requests must be documented in the event planning thread.

### Media Streams

**Region media streams are a shared resource and must be coordinated between events.**

- Scheduled events have priority for media stream usage during their event times
- Pop-up events require moderator approval before changing the region media stream
- Event coordinators should verify stream availability when scheduling events in shared locations
- Media streams should be returned to the default/pre-approved stream after event conclusion
- In cases of stream conflicts, event priority (as outlined in Scheduling & Event Priority) determines stream usage rights

### Posters and Advertising

Appropriate advertising and warning should be given to the Woodcrest Community of the event. Typically this is a post in the #sim-events channel on Discord and a notice in an appropriate Woodcrest Second Life Group(s) (e.g. Woodcrest Roleplay and Woodcrest University).

While no specific rules exist the following guidelines may be considered:

- Advertise as soon as reasonably possible to give people time to plan and make best endeavors to attend.
- A poster is typically used to advertise an event (AI usage is fine).
- Date, Time, Location and Theme/Attire are usually the minimally required information.

A post in #sim-events on Discord and in Second Life Woodcrest Groups may be sent just prior to (e.g. 1 hour prior) and when the event starts.

### Administration Waiver

Woodcrest Administrators may, at their sole discretion, issue waivers to any of the Event Guidelines or Limits.
