## 🌱 Overview

Greek organizations are among the most prestigious and influential groups at Woodcrest University.

Due to limited membership population and finite Greek Row capacity, **new Greek houses are not created directly**. Instead, prospective organizations must progress through a **pre-Greek incubation phase**.

This process exists to protect:
- Established Greek houses
- Community stability
- Long-term sustainability of Greek life

---

## 🏗️ What Is a Pre-Greek Organization?

A pre-Greek organization is a **university-recognized group** that is **not yet a Greek house**.

It allows founders to:
- Build culture and identity
- Recruit organically
- Demonstrate leadership and retention
- Prove long-term viability

Pre-Greek organizations are not considered lesser. They are considered **in evaluation**.

---

## 🚦 Restrictions During Pre-Greek Status

Pre-Greek organizations:
- May not use Greek letters publicly
- May not participate in Rush as Greek
- May not occupy Greek Row housing
- Are not members of Greek Council

These restrictions exist to ensure prestige is earned through action, not branding.

---

## 👥 Membership Protection Rules

To prevent destabilization of existing Greek houses:

- Active members of chartered Greek houses may not join pre-Greek organizations
- Members who leave a Greek house to pursue pre-Greek involvement are subject to a **cooldown period** before eligibility
- Founders may not recruit disproportionately from a single existing Greek house

These rules prioritize community health over short-term growth.

---

## ⏳ Time and Performance Requirements

Pre-Greek organizations must:
- Remain active for a **minimum incubation period** determined by Admins
- Demonstrate consistent leadership
- Meet baseline activity expectations
- Show stable or growing membership retention

Most organizations that cannot sustain momentum will naturally sunset during this phase.

---

## 🧠 Evaluation Criteria

Pre-Greek organizations are evaluated on:
- Leadership stability
- Cultural clarity and mission
- Recruitment practices
- Event consistency
- Impact on the broader community

Meeting requirements does not guarantee Greek charter approval.

---

## 🏛️ Applying for Greek Charter

Once a Greek Row slot becomes available:
- Eligible pre-Greek organizations may apply for charter
- Greek Council reviews applications and conducts hearings
- Admin Team makes final determinations
- Approved organizations enter a probationary Greek cycle

Greek status is awarded at the conclusion of this process, not the beginning.

---

## 📌 Final Philosophy

Greek life at Woodcrest University is designed to be:
- Selective
- Stable
- Earned over time

Prestige without proof weakens the system.  
Proof without prestige builds it.

This process exists to ensure Greek life remains strong, fair, and sustainable.
