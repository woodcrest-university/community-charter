# Code of Conduct

### Embrace Diversity

Woodcrest is a vibrant tapestry of roleplay experiences, languages, and styles. We celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected, regardless of their background or experience level.

Whether you're a seasoned RPer or new to the scene, lead by example, offering guidance and support without elitism or judgment. Foster a spirit of collaboration and shared learning.

### Promote Open Communication

Engaging in local chat helps create a sense of community and inclusion. We encourage you to participate in public discussions and events to enhance the collective roleplay experience.
While private messages (IMs) have their place, especially for welcoming those less inclined to speak up or for handling sensitive matters, always respect privacy and obtain consent to avoid any form of harassment or discomfort.

If you encounter any issues or have concerns, reach out to the community staff or use the designated channels for reporting and assistance.

### Respect Boundaries and Obtain Consent

Consent is the foundation of all interactions within Woodcrest. Always obtain clear consent from other players before engaging in roleplay or imposing any scenarios or actions upon them.
Public roleplay should be mindful of the comfort and boundaries of all community members. Avoid content or behaviors that may be excessively violent, discriminatory, or offensive. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and respect.

For sensitive or mature roleplay themes, ensure that all participants have given explicit consent and conduct such interactions in private settings to maintain a comfortable environment for everyone.

### Strive for Realism and Immersion

In Woodcrest, we aim to create an immersive and believable roleplay experience. Engage in actions and behaviors that are realistic and consistent with the setting and your character's abilities.

Avoid using out-of-character (OOC) information to unfairly influence in-character (IC) decisions or outcomes. Maintain a clear distinction between your character's knowledge and your own.
Respect the established lore, timeline, and environment of Woodcrest. Refrain from introducing elements that disrupt the coherence and consistency of the shared world.


### Collaborate and Respect Events

Events are a cornerstone of the Woodcrest community, requiring significant time, effort, and coordination to plan and execute. They contribute to the richness and vibrancy of our shared roleplay experience, and it is essential that all residents support and respect these events to ensure their success.

When attending or participating in an event, familiarize yourself with the guidelines and expectations set by the organizers. Follow their instructions and adhere to any specific rules or themes that have been established for the event.

Do not intentionally disrupt or derail scheduled events without prior agreement from the event organizers. Respect the time and effort they have invested in creating an immersive and enjoyable experience for all attendees.

If an unexpected situation arises during an event that would realistically call for a change in focus or direction, proceed with the roleplay in a manner that does not significantly undermine the event's intended purpose or disrupt the experience for other participants.

If you have ideas for substantial changes, additions, or prolonged interruptions to an event, discuss them with the event organizers in advance through out-of-character (OOC) communication. Collaborate with them to find ways to incorporate your ideas seamlessly and in a manner that enhances rather than detracts from the event.

Avoid using OOC influence or information to manipulate events or the actions of other characters. Respect the autonomy and agency of all participants, and allow the roleplay to unfold naturally based on in-character motivations and decisions.

Event organizers have the final say in how to proceed with any unexpected interruptions or changes during their events. Respect their decisions and work with them to maintain a cohesive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

### Uphold Community Standards

Woodcrest welcomes a diverse range of avatars, including humans, anthromorphic characters, and ferals. However, we expect all residents to adhere to community standards of decency and respect.

Avatars should be appropriately attired and refrain from overtly sexual or explicit displays in public spaces. Clothing and accessories should be tasteful and non-offensive.

When portraying characters of different ages, especially minors, ensure that your behavior, interactions, and storylines are age-appropriate and do not engage in or depict any form of abuse, exploitation, or sexual content involving underage characters.

### Practice Responsible Roleplay

In Woodcrest, we encourage creative freedom and dynamic storylines, but we also emphasize responsible roleplay practices. Avoid gratuitous violence, gore, or excessively graphic content.

When engaging in combat or conflict-related roleplay, use appropriate tools and systems to determine outcomes fairly. Avoid god-modding or power-gaming to maintain a balance and respect for all participants.

If exploring mature themes or storylines, do so with sensitivity, consent, and appropriate content warnings. Be mindful of the potential impact on others and provide clear indicators or opt-in mechanisms for those who wish to engage.

### Respect Privacy and Personal Boundaries

Woodcrest values the privacy and personal boundaries of all residents. Respect designated private spaces and refrain from entering or accessing them without explicit permission from the owners or occupants.

Avoid sharing or disclosing personal information about other community members without their consent. Respect the privacy and anonymity of those who choose to keep their real-life identities separate from their online personas.

If you capture screenshots or recordings within Woodcrest, obtain consent from all individuals involved before sharing or publishing them in any public forum.

### Be Identifiable and Communicative

To foster a sense of community and accountability, all residents are required to wear the appropriate Woodcrest group tag while participating in roleplay or community events.

If you need to step away or go AFK (away from keyboard), use designated AFK zones or tags to indicate your absence. Remove any out-of-character tags or indicators upon returning to active roleplay.

Communicate clearly and consistently with other players, whether through in-character dialogue, emotes, or OOC discussions. Work together to maintain a smooth and engaging roleplay experience for everyone involved.

### Embrace the Spirit of Collaborative Storytelling

Woodcrest thrives on the collective creativity and contributions of its residents. Approach roleplay with a spirit of collaboration, openness, and willingness to adapt and improvise.

Embrace the unexpected twists and turns that emerge from the actions and decisions of other characters. Allow room for spontaneity and organic development within the shared narrative.

Focus on creating compelling stories, rich character development, and meaningful interactions rather than solely pursuing personal goals or agendas.

### Foster a Supportive and Positive Community

Woodcrest is more than just a roleplay platform; it is a community of individuals coming together to create, explore, and connect. Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and empathy.

Offer support and encouragement to fellow roleplayers, whether they are seasoned veterans or newcomers finding their way. Provide constructive feedback and guidance when appropriate, and be open to learning from others in return.

Celebrate the successes and milestones of the community as a whole. Recognize and appreciate the contributions and achievements of your fellow residents, both in-character and out-of-character.

### Vehicle and Property Use

Vehicles should only be rezzed and used during active roleplay scenes. When not actively participating in roleplay, please store your vehicles to avoid cluttering the environment.

Respect the property and builds of other residents. Do not modify, move, or remove any items without the explicit permission of the owner.

If you encounter any issues with vehicles or property, contact the Woodcrest staff for assistance and guidance.

### Seek Staff Assistance and Support

The Woodcrest staff team is here to support and assist you in your roleplay journey. They work tirelessly to maintain a safe, enjoyable, and immersive environment for all residents.

If you encounter any issues, conflicts, or have questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the staff through the designated channels. They are committed to addressing your needs and finding appropriate solutions.

Treat staff members with respect and understanding, recognizing that they are juggling multiple responsibilities and may occasionally need time to respond or address complex situations.

Remember, this Code of Conduct serves as a guideline to ensure a positive and inclusive roleplay experience for everyone in Woodcrest. It is a living document that may evolve and adapt over time to better serve the needs of the community.

By participating in Woodcrest, you agree to abide by these principles and contribute to creating a welcoming and engaging environment for all residents. Together, we can build a vibrant and thriving roleplay community that inspires creativity, fosters friendships, and creates unforgettable stories.
