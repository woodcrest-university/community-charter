# Code of Conduct

### 1.0 Embrace Diversity

Woodcrest is a diverse community of roleplay experiences, languages, and styles. We strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected, regardless of their background or experience level.

Whether you're a seasoned RPer or new to the scene, lead by example, offering guidance and support without elitism or judgment. Foster a spirit of collaboration and shared learning.

### 2.0 Promote Open Communication

Engaging in local chat helps create a sense of community and inclusion. We encourage you to participate in public discussions and events to enhance the collective roleplay experience.
While private messages (IMs) have their place, especially for welcoming those less inclined to speak up or for handling sensitive matters, always respect privacy and obtain consent to avoid any form of harassment or discomfort.

If you encounter any issues or have concerns, reach out to the community staff or use the designated channels for reporting and assistance.

### 3.0 Respect Boundaries and Obtain Consent

Consent is the foundation of all interactions within Woodcrest. Always obtain clear consent from other players before engaging in roleplay or imposing any scenarios or actions upon them.
Public roleplay should be mindful of the comfort and boundaries of all community members. Avoid content or behaviors that may be excessively violent, discriminatory, or offensive. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and respect.

For sensitive or mature roleplay themes, ensure that all participants have given explicit consent and conduct such interactions in private settings to maintain a comfortable environment for everyone.  If you are unsure about the appropriateness of an action or need to clarify the boundaries of a roleplay situation, it is always safe and encouraged to use private instant messages (IMs) to communicate with the other player(s) involved. This allows for a clear and confidential exchange of consent and expectations without disrupting the flow of the in-character interaction.

When using IMs to obtain consent, be clear and specific about the proposed action or scenario. Provide the other player(s) with enough context and information to make an informed decision. Respect their response and be prepared to adjust or abandon the proposed action if necessary.

Remember, consent can be withdrawn at any time, even if previously given. If a player expresses discomfort or withdraws consent during a roleplay interaction, it is essential to respect their boundaries and adapt accordingly.

### 4.0 Strive for Realism and Immersion

In Woodcrest, we aim to create an immersive and believable roleplay experience. Engage in actions and behaviors that are realistic and consistent with the setting and your character's abilities.

Avoid using out-of-character (OOC) information to unfairly influence in-character (IC) decisions or outcomes. Maintain a clear distinction between your character's knowledge and your own.
Respect the established lore, timeline, and environment of Woodcrest. Refrain from introducing elements that disrupt the coherence and consistency of the shared world.

### 5.0 Collaborate and Respect Events

Events are a cornerstone of the Woodcrest community, requiring significant time, effort, and coordination to plan and execute. They contribute to the richness and vibrancy of our shared roleplay experience, and it is essential that all residents support and respect these events to ensure their success.

When attending or participating in an event, familiarize yourself with the guidelines and expectations set by the organizers. Follow their instructions and adhere to any specific rules or themes that have been established for the event.

Do not intentionally disrupt or derail scheduled events without prior agreement from the event organizers. Respect the time and effort they have invested in creating an immersive and enjoyable experience for all attendees.

If an unexpected situation arises during an event that would realistically call for a change in focus or direction, proceed with the roleplay in a manner that does not significantly undermine the event's intended purpose or disrupt the experience for other participants.

If you have ideas for substantial changes, additions, or prolonged interruptions to an event, discuss them with the event organizers in advance through out-of-character (OOC) communication. Collaborate with them to find ways to incorporate your ideas seamlessly and in a manner that enhances rather than detracts from the event.

Avoid using OOC influence or information to manipulate events or the actions of other characters. Respect the autonomy and agency of all participants, and allow the roleplay to unfold naturally based on in-character motivations and decisions.

Event organizers have the final say in how to proceed with any unexpected interruptions or changes during their events. Respect their decisions and work with them to maintain a cohesive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

### 6.0 Uphold Community Standards

Woodcrest is a community that focuses on realistic human avatars. We encourage residents to create and portray characters that align with this vision.

Avatars should resemble realistic human proportions and appearances. Non-human avatars, such as anthromorphic characters or ferals, are not permitted within the Woodcrest community.

Attachments and accessories should be realistic and appropriate for the setting. Avoid using items that are overly exaggerated, fantastical, or disruptive to the immersive experience.

Residents are expected to ensure that their avatars are appropriately attired and refrain from overtly sexual or explicit displays in public spaces. Clothing and accessories should be tasteful and non-offensive.

#### 6.1 Age Representation and Child Avatar Policy
All Woodcrest sims are classified as 'Adult'. Avatars must depict characters who are 18 years of age or older. **Under no circumstances are human-controlled child avatars permitted within Woodcrest at any time.** The portrayal of underage characters through avatars is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate and strict moderation action.

**Limited Exception for Family Roleplay Props:** Non-avatar children (prim or animesh babies/children) may be used ONLY as temporary props during brief family milestone events under the following strict conditions:
- They may only appear in public spaces for the brief duration of the specific event
- They must remain under direct supervision of the roleplaying parent(s) at all times
- They may not be rezzed in private residences or left unattended anywhere on sim
- They must be immediately removed if any roleplay situation becomes inappropriate for their presence
- **Any decision by a moderator regarding their use must be followed immediately without discussion**
- Their use must comply with all Linden Lab Terms of Service regarding Adult-rated regions

Residents may optionally consult with moderators in advance regarding planned use of these props for family milestone events, though prior approval is not required if all conditions above are met. Any violation of these strict parameters will result in immediate removal of the objects and strict moderation action, potentially including permanent banning.

The portrayal of pregnancy and pregnancy-related roleplay remains permitted. **These guidelines are established to enable meaningful family roleplay moments while ensuring a safe, appropriate environment that protects both our community and complies with platform requirements.**

### 7.0 Practice Responsible Roleplay

In Woodcrest, we encourage creative freedom and dynamic storylines, but we also emphasize responsible roleplay practices. Avoid gratuitous violence, gore, or excessively graphic content.

When engaging in combat or conflict-related roleplay, use appropriate tools and systems to determine outcomes fairly. Avoid god-modding or power-gaming to maintain a balance and respect for all participants.

If exploring mature themes or storylines, do so with sensitivity, consent, and appropriate content warnings. Be mindful of the potential impact on others and provide clear indicators or opt-in mechanisms for those who wish to engage.

As all characters in Woodcrest are portrayed as adults, ensure that your roleplay interactions and themes are appropriate for an adult audience. The depiction of underage characters or storylines involving the exploitation of minors is strictly forbidden.

### 8.0 Respect Privacy and Personal Boundaries

Woodcrest values the privacy and personal boundaries of all residents. Respect designated private spaces and refrain from entering or accessing them without explicit permission from the owners or occupants.

Avoid sharing or disclosing personal information about other community members without their consent. Respect the privacy and anonymity of those who choose to keep their real-life identities separate from their online personas.


### 9.0 Be Identifiable and Communicative

To foster a sense of community and accountability, all residents are required to wear the appropriate Woodcrest group tag while participating in roleplay or community events.

If you need to step away or go AFK (away from keyboard), use designated AFK zones or tags to indicate your absence. Remove any out-of-character tags or indicators upon returning to active roleplay.

Communicate clearly and consistently with other players, whether through in-character dialogue, emotes, or OOC discussions. Work together to maintain a smooth and engaging roleplay experience for everyone involved.

### 10.0 Embrace the Spirit of Collaborative Storytelling

Woodcrest thrives on the collective creativity and contributions of its residents. Approach roleplay with a spirit of collaboration, openness, and willingness to adapt and improvise.

Embrace the unexpected twists and turns that emerge from the actions and decisions of other characters. Allow room for spontaneity and organic development within the shared narrative.

Focus on creating compelling stories, rich character development, and meaningful interactions rather than solely pursuing personal goals or agendas.

### 11.0 Foster a Supportive and Positive Community

Woodcrest is more than just a roleplay platform; it is a community of individuals coming together to create, explore, and connect. Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and empathy.

Offer support and encouragement to fellow roleplayers, whether they are seasoned veterans or newcomers finding their way. Provide constructive feedback and guidance when appropriate, and be open to learning from others in return.

Celebrate the successes and milestones of the community as a whole. Recognize and appreciate the contributions and achievements of your fellow residents, both in-character and out-of-character.

### 12.0 Vehicle and Property Use

Vehicles should only be rezzed and used during active roleplay scenes. When not actively participating in roleplay, please store your vehicles to avoid cluttering the environment.

Respect the property and builds of other residents. Do not modify, move, or remove any items without the explicit permission of the owner.

If you encounter any issues with vehicles or property, contact the Woodcrest staff for assistance and guidance.

### 13.0 Seek Staff Assistance and Support

The Woodcrest staff team is here to support and assist you in your roleplay journey. They work tirelessly to maintain a safe, enjoyable, and immersive environment for all residents.

However, we encourage all residents to first attempt to resolve conflicts or issues directly with the other person or party involved, if appropriate. Open communication, active listening, and a willingness to find mutually agreeable solutions can often lead to a positive outcome without the need for staff intervention.

If you are unable to resolve the situation on your own, or if the issue involves a serious violation of community guidelines or rules, please don't hesitate to reach out to the staff through the designated channels. The staff is committed to addressing your concerns and finding appropriate solutions.

When seeking staff assistance, please provide as much relevant information as possible, including:
- A clear description of the issue or conflict
- The names of the parties involved
- Any relevant screenshots or evidence
- The steps you have already taken to try to resolve the situation

Treat staff members with respect and understanding, recognizing that they are juggling multiple responsibilities and may occasionally need time to respond or address complex situations. The staff will review each case thoroughly and impartially, and will work with all parties involved to find a fair and reasonable resolution.

Remember, this Code of Conduct serves as a guideline to ensure a positive and inclusive roleplay experience for everyone in Woodcrest. It is a living document that may evolve and adapt over time to better serve the needs of the community.

By participating in Woodcrest, you agree to abide by these principles and contribute to creating a welcoming and engaging environment for all residents. Together, we can build a vibrant and thriving roleplay community that inspires creativity, fosters friendships, and creates unforgettable stories.

### 14.0 Group Creation and Approval
In Second Life, groups serve as a means of identification, communication, and moderation within the Woodcrest community. To ensure the integrity and cohesion of our roleplay environment, all groups must be approved and registered with the Woodcrest administration before they can be worn and displayed on the Woodcrest sims.

### 14.1 Group Proposal and Review
If you wish to create a new group within the Woodcrest community, you must submit a proposal to the administration team for review. The proposal should include:

- The purpose and goals of the group
- The proposed group name and tag
- The group's structure and leadership
- How the group will contribute to and enhance the Woodcrest roleplay experience

The administration team will review the proposal and determine whether the group aligns with the values, standards, and objectives of the Woodcrest community. They may request additional information or suggest changes to the proposal before making a final decision.

### 14.2 Group Creation and Registration
If the proposed group is approved by the administration, it must be created by a member of the admin team. This ensures that all groups within the Woodcrest community are properly registered and can be easily identified and managed.

Once created, the group will be added to the Woodcrest sim registry of approved groups. Members of the group will be able to wear the group tag while on the Woodcrest sims without being automatically ejected.

### 14.3 Discord Integration
To facilitate communication and collaboration among group members outside of Second Life, approved groups will also be given a dedicated channel on the official Woodcrest Discord server. This allows group members to connect, plan events, and discuss roleplay opportunities in a centralized location.

The Woodcrest administration reserves the right to monitor and moderate all group-related communication, both within Second Life and on the Discord server, to ensure compliance with the community's rules and guidelines.

By implementing this group creation and approval process, Woodcrest aims to foster a diverse and engaging roleplay environment while maintaining consistency, quality, and adherence to our shared values and standards.

### 15.0 Respect for Staff and Community Decisions

All Woodcrest residents are expected to treat staff members and the community with respect, both in their interactions and when expressing opinions or disagreements. While constructive feedback and open dialogue are encouraged, it must be done in a respectful and professional manner.

#### 15.1 Respectful Communication

When voicing opinions or disagreements with staff decisions or community policies, residents should:
- Use polite and respectful language
- Avoid personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks
- Focus on the issue at hand and provide constructive suggestions or alternative perspectives
- Recognize that staff members are acting in the best interest of the entire community

##### 15.1.1 OOC Communication and IC Actions

The guidelines for respectful communication outlined in section 15.1 primarily apply to out-of-character (OOC) interactions, such as discussions on forums, Discord, or other community platforms.

However, it is important to note that in-character (IC) actions and behaviors that are disrespectful, harassing, or inappropriate towards staff members or the community will be met with appropriate in-character consequences. This may include, but is not limited to:
- IC legal repercussions, such as fines, arrests, or imprisonment
- IC social consequences, such as damaged reputation, loss of trust, or exclusion from certain groups or events
- IC economic consequences, such as loss of contracts, or partnerships

The Woodcrest staff will work with the community to ensure that IC consequences are proportionate, consistent, and in line with the established lore and laws of the shared world.

It is crucial for residents to understand that while IC actions may have IC consequences, they should not be used as a means to circumvent the guidelines for respectful OOC communication. Repeated or severe IC actions that are deemed to be a deliberate attempt to harass, bully, or undermine staff members or the community will be addressed as an OOC violation of the Code of Conduct and may result in the moderation steps outlined in section 15.2.

#### 15.2 Moderation and Penalties

In cases where a resident engages in disrespectful, harassing, or inappropriate behavior towards staff or the community, the following moderation steps will be taken:

1. First offense: The resident will receive a formal warning from the moderation team, outlining the specific behavior that violates the Code of Conduct and the expected corrective action.

2. Second offense: The resident will be temporarily suspended from participating in Woodcrest roleplay and community events for a period determined by the moderation team, based on the severity of the offense. This suspension may include temporary removal from the Woodcrest group, restricted access to sims, or other appropriate measures.

3. Third offense: The resident will be permanently banned from the Woodcrest community, including removal from the Woodcrest group and a permanent ban from all Woodcrest sims.

The administration team reserves the right to escalate the penalty to a higher level, including immediate permanent banning, for severe or egregious violations of the Code of Conduct.

#### 15.3 Reporting and Appeals

If a resident believes they have been unfairly moderated or penalized, they may submit an appeal to the Woodcrest Sim Security, Sim Moderators or Administration teams. The appeal should include:
- A detailed description of the situation and the moderation action taken
- The reasons why the resident believes the moderation was unjust or inappropriate
- Any relevant evidence or screenshots supporting their case

The administration team will review the appeal and make a final decision based on the evidence provided and the best interests of the community. The decision of the administration team is final and binding.

_**Note**: The administration reserves the right to interpret and enforce this Code of Conduct as necessary to maintain the integrity and well-being of the Woodcrest community. Any decisions made by the administration regarding the application of these guidelines are final._

### Additional Notes

Any information or situations not explicitly covered in this Code of Conduct will be addressed and determined by the Woodcrest administration on a case-by-case basis.

The Woodcrest administration reserves the right to return items and remove or prohibit the use of any vehicles deemed unfit or inappropriate for the community without prior notice.

The administration has the authority to permit, modify, or terminate any RP scenario involving any avatar to maintain the integrity and standards of the Woodcrest community.

All residents are expected to comply with the instructions and decisions made by the Woodcrest administrators in the interest of maintaining a safe and enjoyable roleplay environment for all.

#### Excessive Violence

Graphic or gratuitous depictions of violence that go beyond what is necessary for the story or scene. This includes:

- Detailed descriptions of gore, mutilation, or extreme physical harm
- Prolonged or repetitive acts of brutality or cruelty
- Sexualized violence or non-consensual sexual acts
- Glorification or trivialization of real-world atrocities or hate crimes
- Violence targeting vulnerable or marginalized groups in a discriminatory manner

Roleplay involving combat, action, or mild violence is generally acceptable, as long as it is consensual, plot-relevant, and does not cross the line into excessive or gratuitous territory. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and respect the boundaries and comfort levels of all participants.

It's essential to note that consent and clear communication are crucial in any roleplay scenario involving violence. All parties must agree to the content and intensity of the interaction, and anyone should feel free to withdraw consent at any time if they become uncomfortable.

If you encounter instances of excessive violence, please report them to the moderation team, who will review the situation and take appropriate action in accordance with our community guidelines.

Remember, the goal is to foster a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can engage in roleplay without feeling threatened, harassed, or exposed to content that exceeds their personal boundaries.

_**Indemnification:** Woodcrest Township, its owners, administrators, and staff (collectively referred to as "Woodcrest") shall not be held liable for any damages or losses resulting from the actions of its visitors, residents, or employees. Furthermore, Woodcrest is not responsible for any region performance issues or the loss of no-copy items due to factors beyond its control, such as rollbacks, sim crashes, or returned objects. In the event of lost inventory, affected residents should contact Linden Lab directly for assistance._
